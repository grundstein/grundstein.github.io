## early bird <3

hello, you are here a bit early.
feel free to poke around,
but as long as this notice is here,
most documentation on this page will not be accurate (yet).

# grundstein?

@grundstein is our approach to hosting infrastructure and maintenance.

it is (currently in the process of being) purpose built for the
[@magic](https://magic.github.io) [jamstack](https://jamstack.org) generator.

### our goals

reproducible and verifiable builds, down to the kernel.

minimal dependencies on all layers.

free (as in freedom) and open source toolchain.

"not invented here" sometimes is a good thing.

language agnosticity, with a focus on erlang, nodejs and rust support.
